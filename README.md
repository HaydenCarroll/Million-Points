# Million-Points
A screen saver containing a small world of dots. They fight amongst themselves, they consume one another, and if they get to big they pop. 



****Right click on a dot to close****

****Scroll the mouse wheel on a dot to switch monitors****

(sometimes it is off center this can be fixed by scrolling the mouse wheel on a dot)
